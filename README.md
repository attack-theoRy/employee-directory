## Description

Employee Directory is a React app that takes a list of employees / users retrieved from a random user generator api and displays them in a table. The names can be sorted in alphabetical order by clicking "Name" at the top.

The table can also be filtered by name by typing in the input at the top. It filters in real-time with no need to submit.
